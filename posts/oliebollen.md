imgFile: 'oliebollen.jpg'
ingredients:
  - 1 tsp (7 grams) yeast
  - 4 tbsp brown sugar
  - 500ml lukewarm milk (regular or oat milk)
  - 500g flour
  - Pinch of salt
  - 1 egg
  - Raisins – pre-soaked to soften (optional)
  - Several cups of sunflower or canola oil for frying (can be reused)
method:
  - Add yeast, brown sugar, and lukewarm milk to a bowl. Let sit for a couple of minutes to activate the yeast.
  - Mix in flour and salt. The dough should be sticky.
  - Add the egg and mix well.
  - Adjust with more flour or water if needed until the dough is just slightly sticky but manageable.
  - Fold in raisins if using.
  - Cover the bowl with a damp cloth and let the dough rise in a warm place for about an hour until it doubles in size.
  - Heat oil in a deep pot to 180°C. (If the dough browns too quickly, the oil is too hot.)
  - Using a wet spoon, scoop ball-shaped portions into the oil. Fry for 5–6 minutes, turning regularly for even cooking.
  - Remove and drain on paper towels.
  - Serve warm with lots of icing sugar.

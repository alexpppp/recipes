ingredients:
  - 500g peeled pumpkin, diced
  - 1 tablespoon oil
  - 5 cups vegetable stock
  - 1/2 cup white wine
  - 1 brown onion, finely diced
  - 1 1/4 cups arborio rice
  - 1 1/2 cups frozen peas
  - 1 1/2 cups mushrooms, quartered (if button)
  - 1/2 cup sour cream
  - 1/2 bag baby spinach leaves
  - Grated parmesan (or substitute with regular cheese)
  - 2 tablespoons chopped parsley
method:
  - Preheat oven to 220°C. Line an oven tray with baking paper.
  - Toss pumpkin with oil on the tray. Season with salt and pepper. Roast for 15–20 minutes until tender and caramelised.
  - Warm stock in a medium pot and bring to a simmer. Remove from heat, cover and keep warm.
  - Heat a drizzle of olive oil in a large, deep pan and cook onion for 4 minutes until softened.
  - Add rice and stir for 1 minute until it looks translucent. Add mushrooms and cook for another 2–3 minutes.
  - Turn heat to low. Add wine and stir until absorbed.
  - Add stock one cup at a time, stirring often. Wait until each cup is absorbed before adding the next. This should take 20–30 minutes until rice is tender and consistency is porridge-like.
  - If too dry, add ½ cup water; if too wet, cook a little longer.
  - Fold through peas and sour cream, then gently mix in roasted pumpkin and spinach.
  - Season with salt and pepper.
  - Serve with grated parmesan and parsley.

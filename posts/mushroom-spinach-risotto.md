ingredients:
  - 1 litre vegetable stock
  - 2 tbsp olive oil
  - 1 medium onion, finely chopped
  - 1 1/2 cups arborio rice
  - 1/2 cup dry white wine
  - 3 garlic cloves, finely chopped
  - 80g butter or Olivani (half for mushrooms, half for risotto)
  - 500g mushrooms, sliced
  - 400g spinach
  - 1 cup grated parmesan (save some for serving)
  - 2 tbsp chopped parsley (for serving)
method:
  - Heat the vegetable stock in a saucepan and keep on low heat.
  - In a large frypan over low-medium heat, add olive oil and onion. Cook slowly for about 10 minutes until soft.
  - Turn up the heat and stir in the rice until well coated.
  - Add the wine and cook for about 1 minute until absorbed.
  - Add stock one ladle at a time, stirring continuously and waiting for each to absorb before adding the next.
  - Continue until rice is tender with a slight bite (about 30 minutes). Add more stock if needed.
  - In a separate pan, melt 40g butter and cook the mushrooms.
  - Once cooked, stir mushrooms into the risotto with spinach, the remaining 40g butter, and most of the parmesan.
  - Season with salt and pepper. Let sit for 3 minutes.
  - Serve topped with parsley, reserved parmesan, and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil. Optional - crispy bacon on top.

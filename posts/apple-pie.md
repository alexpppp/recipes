title: Apple Pie
tags: ["baking", "dessert"]
ingredients:
  - 2 sheets shortcrust pastry
  - ~8 apples, peeled, cored, and sliced
  - 1/2 cup butter
  - 3 tbsp flour
  - 1/4 cup water
  - 1/2 cup brown sugar
  - 1/2 cup white sugar
method:
  - Preheat oven to 220°C and grease a pie dish.
  - In a saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Stir in flour to form a paste.
  - Add water, brown sugar, and white sugar. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer.
  - Line the base of the pie dish with one sheet of pastry.
  - Add sliced apples, filling generously (mounding is fine).
  - Cut the second pastry sheet into strips and lattice over the top of the pie.
  - Slowly pour the sugar mixture over the lattice, allowing it to soak in evenly without spilling off.
  - Bake at 220°C for 15 minutes, then reduce the temperature to 175°C and bake for another 30–40 minutes until golden and bubbling.

  - 2 tsp vanilla extract
  - 6 eggs
  - 200g flour
  - 200g ground almonds
  - Pinch of sea salt

method:
  - Preheat oven to 180Â°C. Line three 22cm cake tins with baking paper and optionally grease them.
  - Cream olivani and sugar until pale and fluffy.
  - Add vanilla and eggs, one at a time, beating well between each addition.
  - Sift in flour, ground almonds, salt, and baking powder. Mix gently.
  - Add yoghurt and orange zest, mixing until just combined.
  - Divide batter evenly between tins and press in white chocolate chips and blueberries so they are level with or just below the surface.
  - Bake for ~30 minutes until golden brown and a skewer comes out clean.
  - Cool cakes in tins for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a rack to cool completely.
  - For icing, beat cream cheese until smooth. Add lime/lemon juice, vanilla, and maple syrup, and beat until well combined.
  - Assemble the cake by spreading a thin layer of icing between each layer. Stack the layers and ice the top.
  - Top with fresh or frozen blueberries and white chocolate.
  - Store in an airtight container for up to 3 days.

title: Vege Pie
tags: ["dinner"]
ingredients:
  - 3–4 flaky pastry sheets
  - Butter (for greasing and cooking)
  - Potato, peeled and cubed
  - Carrot, peeled and cubed
  - 1–2 medium onions, sliced
  - Leek (optional), sliced
  - Mushrooms, sliced
  - Spinach and/or peas
  - Fresh rosemary and thyme
  - 1.5 cups vegetable stock
  - 3 tbsp cornflour
  - 1 cup milk
  - Grated cheese (for topping)
  - Salt & pepper
method:
  - Peel and cube the potatoes and carrots. Par-boil until just starting to soften, then set aside.
  - In a large pot or pan, melt butter and sauté onions, leeks, and mushrooms for about 10 minutes until soft but not browned.
  - Add rosemary and thyme, then pour in the vegetable stock and bring to a simmer.
  - In a small bowl, mix cornflour with a splash of milk to form a smooth paste. Add this to the pan along with the rest of the milk.
  - Stir over heat until the mixture thickens lightly. Season well with salt and pepper.
  - Stir through the par-boiled potatoes and carrots, along with spinach and peas.
  - Grease a pie dish with butter and line the base with pastry.
  - Pour in the vegetable filling and sprinkle grated cheese on top.
  - Cover with another sheet of pastry, crimp the edges to seal, and lightly glaze with milk or egg white.
  - Bake at 200°C until golden and puffed (usually around 30–40 minutes).

tags: ["baking", "dessert"]
imgFile: 'peach-cobbler.jpg'
ingredients:
  - 50g butter
  - 2 cups flour
  - 1 cup sugar
  - 2 tsp baking powder
  - 1 egg
  - Milk (enough to create a soft scone-like dough)
  - Cinnamon (optional)
  - Tinned or fresh peaches (or other stone fruit)
method:
  - Preheat oven to 180°C.
  - Rub butter into the flour, baking powder, and sugar until crumbly.
  - Add egg and mix in.
  - Gradually add milk until the mixture forms a soft, scone-like dough.
  - Divide dough in half. Roll out one half and press into the base of a small square cake tin.
  - Add sliced peaches (and a sprinkle of cinnamon if using) over the base.
  - Roll out the second half of the dough and place on top.
  - Add a splash of milk over the top if you prefer a softer finish.
  - Bake at 180°C until golden brown and firm to the touch, ideally leaving the middle slightly undercooked for a gooey texture.

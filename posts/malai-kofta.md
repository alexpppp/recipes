ingredients:
  - KOFTAS
  - 750g starchy vegetables (potatoes, carrots, cauliflower—avoid watery veg like courgette/tomato)
  - 1/2 cup breadcrumbs (plus more if needed)
  - 2 tbsp cashew nuts (or almonds)
  - Salt & pepper
  - 1 tsp ground coriander
  - 1 medium egg
  - Plain flour (for coating)
  - Oil (for frying)
  - MALAI SAUCE
  - 2 medium tomatoes, chopped (or 1/2 can chopped tomatoes)
  - 1 medium onion, minced
  - 1 cayenne chilli (optional)
  - 100ml cream
  - 3 cloves garlic, minced
  - 1cm ginger, minced
  - 2 green cardamoms (seeds only)
  - 4 cloves
  - 2cm cinnamon stick
  - 1 tsp turmeric
  - 1 tsp chilli powder (or smoked paprika)
  - 2 tsp garam masala
  - 4 tbsp Olivani or vegetable oil
method:
  - MAKE THE KOFTAS
  - Chop vegetables into 1cm cubes. Microwave with 1/4 cup water for ~8 minutes until soft. Stir halfway through. Avoid excess water.
  - Crush most of the cashews (reserve some for garnish), season with salt, pepper, and ground coriander.
  - Mash cooked vegetables thoroughly. Mix in breadcrumbs and crushed cashews. Don’t over-mix to avoid gluey texture.
  - Mixture should be dry but sticky enough to hold on an inverted spoon. Add more breadcrumbs if needed.
  - Beat egg in one dish, pour flour onto a plate.
  - With wet or oiled hands, shape palm-sized rounds. Dip each in egg, then coat in flour and shape.
  - Shallow fry in hot oil until browned on both sides. Drain on paper towels.
  - MAKE THE MALAI SAUCE
  - Melt Olivani over medium heat. Add cloves, cardamom seeds, and cinnamon stick. Fry ~30 seconds to infuse.
  - Add onion, garlic, ginger, turmeric, and chilli powder. Sauté until onions are soft.
  - Add tomatoes and chilli. Add 1 cup water (and tomato paste if desired). Simmer 10–15 mins until reduced by half.
  - Remove cinnamon stick and blend sauce to a thick gravy.
  - Return to pan on low heat. Stir in cream and season with salt. Add garam masala.
  - Gently place koftas into sauce and warm through.
  - Serve with basmati rice, garnished with reserved cashews.

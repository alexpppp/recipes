title: Asian Rice Salad
tags: ["dinner", "salad"]
source: From Sez and Jack
ingredients:
  - 1 cup rice (brown or long grain)
  - 1/4 cup tamari or soy sauce
  - 1 small red onion (or spring onion), finely diced
  - 1 capsicum, finely diced
  - 1/2 cup currants
  - 3/4 cup edamame beans, blanched
  - 1/2 cup roughly chopped roasted, salted peanuts
  - 1/2 cup toasted sunflower seeds
  - 1/2 cup toasted pumpkin seeds
  - 1/4 cup sesame seeds
  - DRESSING
  - 1/2 cup peanut oil or olive oil
  - 1/4 cup lime juice
  - 2 garlic cloves, crushed
  - 2 tsp ginger, grated
  - 2 tsp soy sauce (I reduced this given the soy sauce in the rice above) 
  - 2 tsp honey
method:
  - Cook the rice, leave to rest.
  - Add the tamari/soy sauce, red onion/spring onion, capsicum, currants and edamame beans. Stir well then leave to sit for at least 2 hours, ideally overnight. 
  - Make the dressing by adding all ingredients to a jar or bowl and stirring. Season. Keep in the fridge until ready to go.
  - Just before you serve, add the remaining ingredients and the dressing, season if needed, and serve.

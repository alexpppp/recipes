time: 25 mins
servings: 12
ingredients:
  - 300g butter, softened  
  - 300g white or caster sugar  
  - 6 eggs  
  - 2 tsp vanilla extract  
  - 300g ground almonds  
  - 75g spelt flour  
  - Zest and juice of 1 large lemon  
  - Zest and juice of 1 large lime  
  - 1 tbsp orange blossom water *(or substitute with orange zest and orange essence)*
icing:
  - 300g cream cheese  
  - 4 tbsp honey  
  - Zest and juice of ½ lemon  
  - ½ tsp vanilla extract
topping:
  - 300g cream cheese  
  - 4 tbsp honey  
  - Zest and juice of ½ lemon  
  - ½ tsp vanilla extract  
method:
  - Preheat oven to 180 degrees Celsius, fan bake. Line three 15cm tins (or two 25 cm tins) with baking paper.
  - Cream the butter and sugar until pale, light and fluffy.
  - Beat in eggs, one at a time, as well as vanilla.
  - Gradually fold in the ground almonds and flour, then the lemon and lime zest and juice and orange blossom water.
  - Divide the batter evenly between the tins.
  - Bake for approximately 30 minutes. The cakes are ready when golden in colour, and a skewer comes out clean.
  - Allow cakes to cool for around 10 minutes before turning out onto a cooling rack.
  - To make the icing beat the cream cheese (ideally with an electric mixer) until smooth. Then add in remaining icing ingredients. You’re aiming for smooth, glossy consistency.
  - Once the cakes are completely cool, spread a layer of icing onto one layer and place another layer directly on top. Repeat the process with the final layer. Top the cake with chosen toppings.

ingredients:
  - 2 tsp yeast
  - 1 1/2 cups water
  - 1 tbsp sugar
  - 1 tsp salt
  - 1 tbsp olive oil
  - 3 cups (420g) high-grade white flour
  - 1 tsp dried oregano
topping:
  - 1 tbsp olive oil
  - Coarse rock or flaky salt
  - Rosemary (optional)
  - Sliced olives (optional)
method:
  - Combine all bread ingredients in a bowl and mix well.
  - Knead on a flat surface for 3–5 minutes.
  - Return dough to the bowl, coat with a little olive oil to prevent sticking, cover with a tea towel, and let rise in a warm place for 45–60 minutes.
  - Once dough has doubled or significantly increased in size, knead again for 3–5 minutes.
  - Tuck edges under to form a loaf shape. Place on lightly oiled baking paper and let rise again in a warm spot for 30–45 minutes.
  - Preheat oven to 225°C.
  - Optionally, top with olive oil, flaky salt, rosemary, and olives.
  - Bake for 15 minutes or until golden brown on top and bottom.

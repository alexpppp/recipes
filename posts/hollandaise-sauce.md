ingredients:
  - 150g butter (Olivani worked)
  - 2 large egg yolks
  - 1 dessert spoon white vinegar
  - 1 lemon
method:
  - Put a pot of water over the heat with a heatproof bowl that can fit inside without touching the water. Bring water to a simmer.
  - Melt the butter in a separate pot or Pyrex jug and set aside.
  - Turn the heat down low. Crack the egg yolks into the heatproof bowl and place it over the pot. Whisk constantly (ensure it doesnâ€™t get too hot or it will scramble).
  - Add the vinegar and continue whisking.
  - Slowly add the melted butter, whisking continuously as it thickens.
  - Season with salt and pepper, then gradually add lemon juice to loosen and balance the flavour. Continue whisking until desired taste and consistency is achieved.

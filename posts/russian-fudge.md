ingredients:
  - 3.5 cups white sugar
  - 125g butter
  - 3 Tbsp golden syrup
  - 1/2 cup milk
  - 1/2 tsp salt
  - 200g sweetened condensed milk
  - 2 tsp vanilla essence
method:
  - Grease a 20cm cake tin. Line with two criss-crossed sheets of baking paper, extending up the sides for easy lifting.
  - In a medium heavy-based saucepan, combine all ingredients except the vanilla.
  - Warm over low heat, stirring, until sugar is completely dissolved (10–15 minutes).
  - Bring to a gentle boil and cook for another 10–15 minutes until mixture reaches soft ball stage (120°C).
  - Remove from heat, stir in vanilla, and let cool for 5 minutes.
  - Beat with an electric mixer for around 10 minutes, until thick, creamy, and no longer glossy.
  - Pour into prepared tin and let cool at room temperature, then refrigerate until fully set.
  - Lift out using the paper, transfer to a board, and cut into small squares.

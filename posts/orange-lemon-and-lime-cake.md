#### Method
1. Preheat oven to 180 degrees Celsius, fan bake. Line three 15cm tins (or two 25 cm tins) with baking paper.
2. Cream the butter and sugar until pale, light and fluffy.
3. Beat in eggs, one at a time, as well as vanilla.
4. Gradually fold in the ground almonds and flour, then the lemon and lime zest and juice and orange blossom water.
5. Divide the batter evenly between the tins.
6. Bake for approximately 30 minutes. The cakes are ready when golden in colour, and a skewer comes out clean.
7. Allow cakes to cool for around 10 minutes before turning out onto a cooling rack.
8. To make the icing: beat the cream cheese (ideally with an electric mixer) until smooth. Then add in remaining icing ingredients. You’re aiming for smooth, glossy consistency.
9. Once the cakes are completely cool, spread a layer of icing onto one layer and place another layer directly on top. Repeat the process with the final layer. Top the cake with chosen toppings.

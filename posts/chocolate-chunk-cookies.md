tags: ["baking", "dessert", "snack"]
ingredients:
  - 200g Olivani (or butter)
  - 1 1/2 cups brown sugar, packed
  - 2 eggs
  - 1 tbsp vanilla essence
  - 1 tsp baking soda
  - 1 tsp salt
  - 2 2/3 cups flour
  - 2 cups chocolate chunks *(white & dark chocolate combo is great, or sub in macadamias + white choc)*
method:
  - Beat Olivani and brown sugar on medium speed for 3 minutes until creamy.
  - Add eggs and vanilla and mix for another minute, until the mixture lightens slightly in colour.
  - Add baking soda and salt, and mix for 30 seconds on medium.
  - Turn mixer to low and gradually add flour until just incorporated.
  - Stir in chocolate chunks (or your mix-ins of choice).
  - Chill the dough for at least 2 hours, or until stiff.
  - Preheat oven to 175°C while dough chills.
  - Spoon onto a lined baking tray and bake for 10–12 minutes, until lightly golden at the edges.
  - TIP: You can roll the dough into balls and freeze them. Bake straight from frozen whenever you want fresh cookies!

  - 3 medium carrots, grated

method:
  - Place lentils in a pot with water and bring to the boil. Simmer for 35–40 minutes until tender.

  - Heat olive oil and butter in a pan, then sauté vegetables gently for 5–7 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
  - Drain lentils and lightly mash with a fork—don’t overdo it.
  - Mix in tomato puree, 1–2 eggs, sautéed vegetables, garlic, herbs, and cayenne. Be careful not to overmix or it will become runny. Let mixture cool.

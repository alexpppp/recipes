ingredients:
  - 12 large ripe tomatoes
  - 4 medium onions
  - Handful of salt (a “woman’s handful”)
  - Malt vinegar (enough to cover)
  - 1 tbsp curry powder
  - 1/2 tbsp mustard powder
  - 5–6 chillies (or 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper)
  - 3 cups sugar
  - Pinch of ground ginger
  - Pinch of ground cloves
method:
  - Chop tomatoes and onions, then place in a bowl with the salt. Cover and leave for 12 hours.
  - After 12 hours, pour off the liquid and cover the mixture with malt vinegar.
  - Sterilise glass jars in the oven at 100°C for 30 minutes. Wash jars first in hot soapy water and rinse well.
  - Bring the tomato and onion mixture to a boil and boil for 5 minutes.
  - In a small bowl, mix curry powder, mustard powder, chillies (or cayenne), ginger, and cloves with a little vinegar to form a runny paste.
  - Add the spice paste and sugar to the pot and boil gently for 45 minutes to 1 hour, stirring occasionally.
  - Meanwhile, boil the jar lids in water for a couple of minutes.
  - When the relish is ready and thickened, pour into hot sterilised jars and seal immediately with boiled lids.
  - Let jars cool. Check that a vacuum seal has formed. If not, store in the fridge and consume within a few months.
  - Properly sealed jars will last 1–2 years in a cool, dark place.

imgFile: 'burnt-broccoli.jpeg'
ingredients:
  - 1 head of broccoli
  - 1 tbsp butter
  - 2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
  - 2 tbsp sliced or chopped almonds
method:
  - Chop broccoli into florets.
  - Heat oil in a large pan over high heat until almost smoking (you should hear it crackle).
  - Add broccoli and do not move it until it starts to char on one side.
  - Flip each floret and allow the other side to char.
  - Add about 20ml water to deglaze the pan.
  - Push broccoli to one side and add butter, garlic, and almonds to the other. Cook for 1 minute.
  - Toss everything together to coat the broccoli in the buttery, garlicky goodness.
  - Serve immediatelyâ€”this dish is best super hot.

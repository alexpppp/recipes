ingredients:
  - 3 1/3 cups all-purpose or bread flour
  - 1/4 tsp instant yeast
  - 1 1/4 tsp salt
  - 1 1/2 cups lukewarm water
method:
  - In a large bowl, combine flour, yeast, and salt.
  - Add lukewarm water and stir until blended. The dough will be shaggy and sticky.
  - Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let rest at room temperature (around 18°C) for at least 12 hours, preferably 18.
  - The dough is ready when the surface is dotted with bubbles.
  - Lightly flour a work surface and turn out the dough. Sprinkle with more flour and fold it over on itself twice. Let rest for 15 minutes.
  - Shape dough into a ball using just enough flour to prevent sticking.
  - Generously flour a tea towel, place dough seam side down, dust with more flour, and cover with another towel. Let rise for about 2 hours until doubled in size and it doesn't spring back when poked.
  - 30 minutes before the dough is ready, place a covered cast iron or ceramic pot into the oven and preheat to 230°C.
  - When dough is ready, carefully remove the pot from the oven. Turn dough into the pot, seam side up.
  - Cover and bake for 20 minutes, then remove the lid and bake for another 10–15 minutes until nicely browned.

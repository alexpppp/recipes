ingredients:
  - 400ml lukewarm milk
  - 1 tsp sugar
  - 3 tsp yeast
  - 5 cups flour
  - 125g butter, melted
  - 2 eggs, lightly beaten
  - 1/2 cup white or caster sugar

  - 2–3 cups brown sugar
  - 1 tbsp cinnamon
icing:
  - 2 cups icing sugar
  - 2 tbsp cream cheese
  - 1 tsp vanilla essence
method:
  - Warm the milk and mix in the 1 tsp sugar and yeast. Let it sit for about 10 minutes until foamy.
  - In a large bowl, mix flour, salt, and white sugar. Whisk to remove any lumps.
  - Once the yeast is activated, add it to the dry ingredients along with the eggs and melted butter.
  - Mix to combine, then transfer to a floured bench. Sprinkle with flour and knead well.
  - Return dough to a greased bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let rise in a warm spot until doubled in size.
  - (Optional) At this point, the dough can be refrigerated overnight to continue the next day.
  - Once risen, tip dough onto a floured surface and roll into a rectangle approx. 24 x 10 inches.
  - Spread with softened or melted butter, then sprinkle with brown sugar and cinnamon.
  - Roll up into a log and cut into 2-inch-wide scrolls.
  - Place on a lined tray, brush with milk, cover, and let rise again for about an hour.
  - Preheat oven to 180°C (non-fan bake).
  - Bake for 15–20 minutes until golden brown.
  - Once cool, drizzle with icing made by combining icing sugar, cream cheese, and vanilla essence.
  - Makes approximately 15 scrolls.

ingredients:
  - 3 tbsp Olivani
  - 2 leeks, trimmed and roughly chopped
  - 1 large kumara (approx. 400g), peeled and cut into 3cm chunks
  - Salt & pepper
  - 1 tsp ground cumin
  - 1 tsp curry powder
  - 1 tsp ground turmeric
  - 1 tsp garam masala
  - 1/4 cup plain flour
  - 1 cup milk
  - 1 1/2 cups cooked lentils (about 3/4 cup dried brown lentils, simmered and drained)
  - 1 1/3 cups cooked broccoli florets
  - 1 1/3 cups cooked cauliflower florets
  - 1 cup grated cheese
  - 1/4 cup chopped coriander
  - 6 sheets puff pastry
  - 1 egg, whisked (for brushing)
  - 2 tsp sesame seeds
method:
  - Melt Olivani in a large heavy-based pot over medium heat. Add leeks, kumara, salt, pepper, and all the spices. Cook for about 30 minutes until the kumara is just soft.
  - Sprinkle over flour and stir well. Add milk and cook until the sauce thickens.
  - Stir in cooked lentils, broccoli, cauliflower, and cheese. Heat gently until the cheese just melts.
  - Remove from heat, stir in chopped coriander, and allow to cool. Refrigerate the mixture until ready to use.
  - Lightly oil six 11cm pie tins. Cut circles and strips of puff pastry to line the bases and sides of each tin (some patching may be needed).
  - Fill with the curry mixture. Cut pastry lids slightly larger than the bases, brush pastry edges with egg, and seal with the lids. Press down around edges with your thumbs.
  - Trim excess pastry, then brush tops with egg and sprinkle with sesame seeds.
  - Chill pies in the fridge while preheating oven to 180°C.
  - Bake pies for 35–40 minutes, or until golden brown.
  - Let sit for a few minutes before removing from tins. If bases need extra cooking, invert pies and return to oven briefly.
  - Serve hot with tomato chutney or classic tomato sauce.

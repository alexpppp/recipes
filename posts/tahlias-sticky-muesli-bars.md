title: Tahlia’s Sticky Muesli Bars
tags: ["baking", "snack"]
ingredients:
  - 1 cup almonds
  - 1 cup peanuts
  - 1 cup cashews  
    *(or use 3 cups of any mixed nuts)*
  - 1/4 cup pumpkin seeds
  - 1/4 cup sunflower seeds
  - 1/4 cup sesame seeds
  - 1/2 cup honey
  - 1/3 cup maple syrup
  - 1/4 tsp salt
  - 1 tsp vanilla extract
method:
  - Grease and line a 9×13 inch dish with baking paper, leaving overhang for easy removal. Brush lightly with coconut oil. Prepare a second sheet for the top.
  - Preheat oven to 180°C. Spread nuts on a tray and roast lightly until fragrant.
  - Add roasted nuts to a large bowl with all the seeds.
  - In a saucepan, combine honey, maple syrup, and salt. Bring to the boil and continue boiling until the mixture reaches 260°F (hard ball stage), if using a candy thermometer.
  - Stir in vanilla and immediately pour over the nut and seed mixture. Mix quickly to coat everything evenly.
  - Transfer into the prepared dish, cover with the second sheet of paper, and press down firmly using a jar or glass to compact the mixture.
  - Refrigerate until fully cooled and firm, then slice into bars.

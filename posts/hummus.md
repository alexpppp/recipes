  It has taken me a long time to find a hummus recipe to my liking… smooth and light, but flavoursome.
  Turns out, a lot of the consistency comes from the order in which you blend the ingredients!
  After many messy tests, I've found that a traditional food blender still works best over high-powered gadgets.

ingredients:
  - 3 tbsp tahini
  - Juice of 1 large lemon
  - 400g boiled or canned chickpeas
  - 4 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
  - 2 cloves garlic, minced
  - 1/2–1 tsp salt
  - 1/2 tsp ground cumin
  - 2 tbsp water (as needed)
  - Pinch of paprika (for garnish)

method:
  - Start by mixing tahini and lemon juice in your food processor for about 1 minute, until thick and light in colour.
  - Add the chickpeas and process until finely minced.
  - Add minced garlic and gradually pour in the olive oil while blending. Continue until smooth and well incorporated.
  - Season with salt and cumin. Add water a tablespoon at a time if needed for a creamier consistency.
  - Blend for another minute to finish.
  - Garnish with a pinch of paprika before serving.

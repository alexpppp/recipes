title: Carla’s Chilli Jam
tags: ["misc", "snack"]
ingredients:
  - 500g tomatoes
  - 4–8 chillies (depending on size and heat preference)
  - 4 cloves garlic, peeled and roughly chopped
  - 6cm piece of ginger, peeled and roughly chopped
  - 30ml fish sauce
  - 300g sugar
  - 100ml red wine vinegar
method:
  - Place half the tomatoes in a blender with the chillies, garlic, ginger, and fish sauce. Blitz until smooth.
  - Finely dice the remaining chillies.
  - Transfer the purée to a saucepan and add sugar and vinegar. Stir continuously and bring to a boil.
  - Once boiling, reduce to a simmer and add the remaining tomatoes.
  - Simmer gently for 30–40 minutes, stirring frequently and scraping down the sides to prevent sticking or burning.
  - Meanwhile, sterilise jars in the oven at 100°C for 30 minutes. Boil the lids for the final 5 minutes.
  - Once the jam has thickened and reached setting point (sticky consistency), pour into the hot sterilised jars and seal.

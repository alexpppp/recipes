  - For the onions - Slice thinly, sauté in oil with brown sugar until soft and caramelised. Stir into cooked rice and lentils.
  - To make the tomato sauce - Sauté garlic and chilli paste in oil for 2 minutes. Add cumin and paprika, cook for another minute.
  - Add vinegar and let boil for 1 minute, then add tomatoes and 1 tin of water. Simmer gently while rice finishes cooking.

ingredients:
  - 2 medium eggplants, sliced lengthwise ~0.75cm thick
  - Sea salt
  - Olive oil
  - 1 small yellow onion, diced
  - 2 large garlic cloves, minced
  - 1/4 tsp red chilli flakes
  - Dash of cinnamon
  - 1 can diced tomatoes
  - 2 tbsp fresh parsley, finely chopped (divided)
  - (OPTIONAL) Cream cheese chunks, to serve
method:
  - Lightly salt the eggplant slices and let sit briefly. Brown both sides in a hot, oiled cast iron pan until golden (but not burnt). Set aside.
  - In the same or a separate pan, sauté onion over medium heat for 3–5 minutes.
  - Add garlic, chilli flakes, 1/2 tsp sea salt, and a dash of cinnamon. Cook for 1 minute until fragrant.
  - Add the diced tomatoes and simmer for about 5 minutes until slightly thickened.
  - Remove from heat and stir in half of the parsley.
  - In a cast iron pan or oven-safe dish, layer sauce, eggplant, more sauce, more eggplant—like a lasagna.
  - Cover and simmer gently for 45 minutes until the eggplant is silky soft and the sauce has reduced.
  - Let rest for 10 minutes before slicing.
  - Garnish with the remaining parsley. Serve warm or at room temperature. Add cream cheese chunks on top if desired.
